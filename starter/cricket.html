            <p>In 1844, the first-ever international match took place between the United States and Canada.[44] In 1859,
                a team of
                English players went to North America on the first overseas tour.[45] Meanwhile, the British Empire had
                been
                instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well
                established in
                Australia, the Caribbean, India, Pakistan, New Zealand, North America and South Africa.[46]

                In 1862, an English team made the first tour of Australia.[47] The first Australian team to travel
                overseas consisted of
                Aboriginal stockmen who toured England in 1868.[48] The first One Day International match was played on
                5 January 1971
                between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.[49]

                In 1876–77, an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognised as the first-ever Test
                match at the
                Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia.[50] The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to
                The Ashes in
                1882, and this has remained Test cricket's most famous contest.[51] Test cricket began to expand in
                1888–89 when South
                Africa played England.</p>
            <h2>Innings</h2>
            <p>The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play
                during a match.
                Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. Sometimes all
                eleven members of
                the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all
                done so. The
                innings terminates if the batting team is "all out", a term defined by the Laws: "at the fall of a
                wicket or the
                retirement of a batter, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is available to come
                in".[66] In this
                situation, one of the batters has not been dismissed and is termed not out; this is because he has no
                partners left and
                there must always be two active batters while the innings is in progress.

                An innings may end early while there are still two not out batters:[66]

                the batting team's captain may declare the innings closed even though some of his players have not had a
                turn to bat:
                this is a tactical decision by the captain, usually because he believes his team have scored sufficient
                runs and need
                time to dismiss the opposition in their innings
                the set number of overs (i.e., in a limited overs match) have been bowled
                the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time
                in the final innings of the match, the batting side has reached its target and won the game.</p>
