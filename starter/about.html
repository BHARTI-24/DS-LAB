        <p>We are grateful to the management for providing Indoor & outdoor stadiums and well equipped gym facilities
          with
          International standards. The Majestic Indoor Stadium we see today at B.M.S.C.E is the result of the Physical
          Education
          Director's vision and hard work and also the encouragement by BMS Management. In the year 2000 he prepared the

          and the

        <h2>Indoor Games</h2>
        <p>Like outdoor games, indoor games also physically and morally develop an all-round personality of the player.
        </p>
        <p></p>Indoor games like table tennis, carrom or chess are much more than outdoor games. They improve a player's
        skill, foresight and thinking abilities.<p>
        <p>They encourage the spirit of competition. They teach cooperation and sportsmanship. They also teach lessons
          of
          tolerance
          and discipline. Indoor games should be included in the education curriculum to impart positive values unto the
          students.</p>

        <h2>Outdoor Games</h2>
        <p>Different kinds of outdoor games are there. The games like badminton, cricket, football and volleyball are
          all

          overall
          health
          problems get resolved by playing these games. They refresh our mind and body.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, playing games on electronic gadgets like mobile phones and computers harms people’s
          especially
          of
          children’s eyesight. It is also it makes one lazy and inactive. Outdoor games help children to develop
          important
          life
          skills. Children learn to communicate with people confidently. They develop a competitive spirit in them. They
          also
          develop a positive attitude.</p>
        <p>As a result, their whole personality gets to improve as it develops their creative skills. It helps them
          improve
          their
          reasoning power.</p>
