            <h1>About table tennis</h1>
            <h2>table tennis content</h2>
            <p>Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a
                lightweight ball,
                also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small rackets. The game takes
                place on a hard
                table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must
                allow a ball
                played toward them to bounce once on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces on
                the opposite side
                at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast
                and demands quick
                reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a
                great
                advantage.

                Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF),
                founded in 1926.
                ITTF currently includes 226 member associations.[3] The table tennis official rules are specified in the
                ITTF
                handbook.[4] Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[5] with several event categories. From
                1988 until 2004,
                these were men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles. Since 2008, a team event
                has been played
                instead of the doubles.</p>
